I'm a student at the University of Georgia, studying Cognitive Science, AI, and Economics.

I currently intern for [Data For Progress](https://www.dataforprogress.org/).

I also co-founded [athens.ai](https://athensai.org/), which helps local small businesses and non-profits integrate LLMs into their operations. 

I'm interested in computational social science, cities, and writing.

Here is my [CV](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gvAbFykdiyNmMRb0apVpWkv5W9Q_xap-L2AnWximS0w/edit?usp=sharing).
